Click on the `Binder` badge to run the AA ROI demo.

The goal of the AA ROI Jupyter notebook is to explain the Savings calculation algorithm for a Job Template.

The notebook presents all the relevant data from the CSV files that is required for the ROI calculation in a comprehensive tabular format, 
allowing you to visually calculate certain key attributes like `successful_host_run_count` and `successful_elapsed_sum`

The ROI Jupyter notebook contains an interactive dropdown for selecting templates.
Savings calculation is displayed for the Job Template that is selected from the dropdown.

Upload your custom CSVs and experiment!
Experiment with CSV table exports - `unified_jobs_fk.csv` and `job_events_fk.csv` from various databases OR 
alternatively extract the CSVs - `unified_jobs_table.csv` and `events_table.csv` from the tarball.
